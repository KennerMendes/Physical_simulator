      <h2>Le Chatelier's Principle</h2>
      <p>
        This principle claims that if you disturb a chemical equilibrium, that reaction
        will be accelerated towards relieving the stressor. The simulation below
        represents the following chemical equilibrium:<br>
        A + B ⇌  C + D <br>
        Where green particles are A substance molecules, yellow particles are B, red particles
        are C and blue particles are D. When A and B collide with enough velocity (in this
        simplified simulation) they become C and D and vice versa. Realize at initial
        situation you, at most of the time, see 3 particles of each substance. Click
        over the simulation to disturb the equilibrium adding more A particles and
        increasing its concentration.

      <p>
        When equilibrium is disturbed, it advances towards reducing A concentration.
        As a result, direct reaction will be accelerated, decreasing A and B
        concentrations and increasing C and D concentrations. Realize when the new
        equilibrium is reached, at the most of time, you see 1 yellow particle
        (B substance) indicating the described phenomenom happened.
