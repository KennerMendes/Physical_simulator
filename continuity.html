      <h2>Continuity Equation</h2>
      <p>
        Continuity equation only says when you strangle some flow, fluid velocity will
        increase after the tightness (to keep the flow constant).<br>
        The simulation below is a simplified representation of this phenomenon.
        We will use a particle system rather than fluid itself, the particle's color
        refers to its horizontal velocity (flow direction): green for very slow,
        red for very fast and yellow for moderate. To tight the flow, put mouse over
        simulation and press mouse button; to free the flow, only release the button.

        In the normal flow (no tightness) particles are predominantly yellow.
        When you strangle this flow, a lot of particles before tightness become
        green and after tightness, some particles become red, indicating avarage
        flow velocity after tightness is higher then before.<br>
        Thinking about space, this phenomenon makes sense too. Before tightness
        there is space enough to a lot of particles pass throug at the same time,
        after tightness there is space for only one, so it is pretty much reasonable
        to admit particles before tightness will flow slower then after.<br>
        However, realize that the pressure (in our model it is represented by particles
        collisions) is higher before tightness than after (for more clarifications
        search for Bernoulli's equation). Realize too, our simulation is just a
        simplification with solid particles, not a real fluid, what means we don't
        heave constant "pressure", hence we will not have constant flow velocity,
        because of this you see some green particles after tightness too.
