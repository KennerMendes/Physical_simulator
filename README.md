# Physical_simulator

(This is my CS50x Final Project)

This project is inspired by some videos I have watched earlier this year. These videos are didactic simulations for Linear
Algebra and Complex Numbers. As my CS50x final project, I have created simulations about physics and chemistry in a 
website.
In this project I have used JavaScript, ProcessingJS, html e css.
To use it, just follow instructions in website itself.
