        This website's purpouse is provide some beaultifull and usefull visualizations of
        some non-trivial phenomena.<br>
        The following simulations are not an exact reprodution of real world, there are
        simplifications, even so, your didatic value is not affected.

      <h2>Entropy</h2>
      <p>
        Entropy is something linked to molecular randomness, how many different forms
        (micro states) is possible some system assumes and still being that system
        (macro state). And in a spontaneous process, it always increases.<br>
        The simulation below is going to show you how looks like the entropy increase.
        With mouse over the simulation, press mouse button to remove the barrier
        between the two sides. Release it to restore the division.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you remove the barrier, you allow energy being distributed among more
        particles in more positions, therefore there are more micro states, entropy
        increases. When you restore barrier, the initial situation will not return,
        energy will still be more distributted, entropy is not going to decrease.
